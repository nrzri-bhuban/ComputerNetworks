## HOW TO RUN
Same as As11, but ICMP packets are used here.

1. Create a network with 6 hosts using mininet.  
2. Run the compiled code (attacker) in host 6.  
3. Run wireshark in host 1 (victim) to capture traffic.

#### Wireshark capture file :  [As12.pcapng](As12.pcapng)  
#### OUTPUT

***Note : You may change the attacker, agents and victims to your liking in the code***
